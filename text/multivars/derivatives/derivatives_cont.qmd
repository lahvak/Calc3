## Review

For a function of several variables, we have defined the _directional
derivative_ in the direction of a _unit vector_ $\vec{u}$ as

$$f_{\vec{u}}(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) = \lim_{h \to 0} 
\frac{f(x_1 + hu_1, x_2 + hu_2, \dots, x_n+hu_n) - f(x_1, x_2, \dots,
x_n)}{h}$$

We then defined _partial derivatives_ of $f$ as directional derivatives in the
direction of one of the _standard basis vectors_, that is unit vectors in the
directions of the coordinate axes.

In two dimensions, these are the vectors $\vec{i}$ and $\vec{j}$, leading to
the partial derivative _with respect to $x$_:

$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y) = f_x(x,y) = f_{\vec{i}}(x,y) = D_{\vec{i}} f(x,y)$$

and 

$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y) = f_y(x,y) = f_{\vec{j}}(x,y) = D_{\vec{j}} f(x,y)$$

In three dimensions we also add the partial derivative with respect to $z$,
corresponding to the vector $\vec{k}$.

We also learned what it means for a function of several variables to be
_differentiable_:  It is not enough to just have all the partial derivatives.
A function $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is _differentiable at a point $A =
(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)$_ if it can be well approximated near $A$ by a linear
function $L:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$.  Formally. $f$ is differentiable at
$A$ if there exists a linear function $L$ such that 

$$\lim_{(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n)\to (a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)}\frac{f(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n) -
L(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)}{\norm{\v{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n} - \v{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n}}} =
0$$

In two variables, it simply means that the surface graph of the function has a
_tangent plane_.

For example, the following surface graph shows a function that has _all
directional derivatives_ at the origin, but is not differentiable there:

```{r}
illustr("../../../asymptote/multivar/derivatives/nodiff1.html", title = "A surface graph of a function that has all directional derivatives at (0,0) but is nit differentiable there", width=500, height=500)
```

Finally, we learned that for a _differentiable_ function, the __gradient
vector__ defined as

$$\vec{\nabla}f(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n) = \v{
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}(x_1, x_2,\dots,x_n),
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}(x_1, x_2,\dots,x_n),
\dots,
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}(x_1, x_2,\dots,x_n)
}$$

is very useful.  For example, _if $f$ is a differentiable function at $A$_,
then for any __unit__ vector $\vec{u}$ the _directional derivative_ of $f$ at $A$
in the direction $\vec{u}$ can be calculated as

$$D_\vec{u} f(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n) = \vec{\nabla}f(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)\cdot \vec{u}.$$
